		Download and install anaconda following the steps:https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/
	
	c.Download and install the latest NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN
		Download NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive
		Download cuDNN from https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive
		Install CUDA by simply running the executable file (.exe)
		Unzip the cuDNN library and move all the files to the CUDA directory

	d.Create a virtual environment and install python
		Open Anaconda Prompt and type the following command: conda create -n python_tensorflow
		Activate the environment: conda activate python_tensorflow

	e.Using the Anaconda Promt install the following packages in the environment created:
		Tensorflow: pip install tensorflow
		Numpy: pip install numpy
		OpenCV: pip install opencv-python
		Flask:  pip install Flask
		IPython: pip install ipython
		Json:  pip install jsonlib
		Jupyter: pip install jupyter

	f.Create a new folder using jupyer notebook and paste the code inside

	g.Open and run the code.
		In Jupyter Notebook click on kernel and then on restart and run all
	
	h.Hardware requirements
		Processor: Intel core i5
		Ram:16GB
		GPU:7GB comaptible with tensorflow, CUDA and cuDNN	

Backend and database connection

1. All required librieries for the backedn are writen in requirements_backend.txt 
2. Import the tables from the Team Project Folder into a mysql(or prefered datbase service) schema 
3. Host the database locally or on any prefered service and modify the code on line 43 to path to the imported schema
4. to host the backend locally enter the envirment where all the requirements_backend.txt are, run the terminal use the commands set FLASK_APP=backend.py and flaks run

Frontend:

1. Download and install the node.js engine from https://nodejs.org/en/ .
2. Open a command line in the root of the frontend folder.
3. Execute 'npm install @angular/cli' and wait for the installation to finish.
4. Execute 'npm install' to install angular project dependencies.
5. In the frontend folder access the "src" folder, than the "environments" folder.
6. In the file named einvironment.ts make sure that the url path is the fallowing 'http://localhost:5000' .
7. Excute 'ng serve -o' to run the frontend project and wait for process to complete.
